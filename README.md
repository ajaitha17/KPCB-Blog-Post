While working at PagerDuty last summer, I was asked to work on setting up an instance of Looker for the company. I did a lot of data modelling that led to me falling in love with the product. Apart from it being extremely useful, I loved how they thought of the product from the perspective of the engineer and the non-technical users. 

For an engineer, creating version control through git and creating a layer of abstraction that separated the Looker code from the database code gave confidence in the reliability. While there was a new langauge to learn, it was simple enough to pick up easily. Further, it was reliable enough for us to use it with the confidence that a model we built would work as long as we did it correctly; we did not have to worry about their product crashing. Engineers could also make edits to the model without having it affect the user's use case. Further, they could only show a user as much as they needed to see so they don't get overwhelmed with data they have to idea how to work with.

From the perspective of a non-technical user, the simplicity of the click and drag options made using the product very easy. The intuitive design made for a quick setup process.

Overall, the impression we got was that the company made the product to make a great product and not to fulfil certain needs of just a few big contracts. Having a holistically good product realy paid off in the end.
